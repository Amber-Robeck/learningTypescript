 ## Description

_The purpose: Create an application with Typescript to help me learn typescript._

_The idea: Searched up free api's and found [MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S API](https://dictionaryapi.com/ "Merriam-websiter-API"). Thought it would be cool to create a word find that was dynamically updated with random words everytime it was loaded, using the definitions as the clues._

  This page is currently deployed on [github pages](https://amber-robeck.github.io/learningTypescript/ "deployed link")
